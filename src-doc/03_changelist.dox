Release		| Date			| Description
------------|---------------|------------
1.5.13-1	| 2023-12-26	| Changed %DarkHelp build from static @p .a file to shared @p .so file.  You may need to delete your @p CMakeCache.txt file if you get an error about @p libdarkhelp.a since we now build @p libdarkhelp.so.
1.5.5-1		| 2023-10-11	| Changed @ref DarkHelp::Config::redirect_darknet_output to default to @p FALSE when using the %DarkHelp CLI, since this was masking Darknet errors for new users.  (The API still defaults to @p TRUE.)
1.5.2-1		| 2023-07-08	| Added @ref DarkHelp::Config::use_fast_image_resize and @ref DarkHelp::slow_resize_ignore_aspect_ratio().
1.5.1-1		| 2023-05-02	| Added @ref DarkHelp::PositionTracker to track objects while processing videos. This adds 1 new field to prediction results, making the structure larger.
1.5.0-1		| 2023-02-08	| Merge changes from user "olokos" to better support building in Windows.
1.4.31-1	| 2022-12-21	| Added @ref DarkHelp::NN::image_channels() which will normally return @p 3.
1.4.27-1	| 2022-09-01	| Fixed OpenCV DNN driver so it doesn't miss any detections. Should be the same as Darknet but much faster.
1.4.24-1	| 2022-08-30	| New function and config option to redirect Darknet's output to @p /dev/null or @p NUL:.  @ref DarkHelp::Config::redirect_darknet_output
1.4.22-1	| 2022-07-04	| Options to pixelate prediction results has been added.  @ref DarkHelp::Config::annotation_pixelate_enabled
1.4.19-1	| 2022-06-24	| Added RoI to DarkHelp Server.
1.4.18-1	| 2022-04-25	| Make snapping run much faster (detects when a snap is growing out of control).
1.4.16-1	| 2022-04-14	| Added @ref DarkHelp::Config::annotation_suppress_all_labels to completely hide labels.
1.4.15-1	| 2022-04-02	| Attempt to fix (simplify?) rather opaque cv::waitKeyEx() which was no longer working on my system.
1.4.14-1	| 2022-03-24	| Exception will now be thrown if a blank line is detected within the .names file since that causes darknet to hang in some situations.
1.4.12-1	| 2022-02-15	| Added @ref DarkHelp::Config::snapping_limit_shrink and @ref DarkHelp::Config::snapping_limit_grow.
1.4.9-1		| 2022-01-28	| Added several @p yolo_* functions for convenience, such as @ref DarkHelp::yolo_load_annotations().
1.4.8-1		| 2022-01-24	| Added annotation "snapping" (see @ref DarkHelp::Config::snapping_enabled).
1.4.6.1		| 2021-12-04	| Important fix for OpenCV DNN:  images need to be in RGB not BGR.
1.4.1-1		| 2021-10-29	| Created the @ref DarkHelp namespace, and split the classes into @ref DarkHelp::NN, @ref DarkHelp::Config, and @ref DarkHelp::PredictionResult.  This is the last part of what was started in v1.4.0 a few days ago, and is also a breaking change to the %DarkHelp C++ API.
1.4.0-1		| 2021-10-24	| Created @ref DarkHelp::Config to contain the configuration items.  This introduces some breaking changes to users of %DarkHelp's C++ API.
1.3.0-1		| 2021-10-03	| Added (experimental!) support for using OpenCV's DNN module. @ref DarkHelp::EDriver
1.2.2-1		| 2021-09-13	| Added camera (webcam) support to DarkHelp Server.
1.2.0-1		| 2021-09-09	| Added @ref Server.
1.1.17-1	| 2021-08-02	| Added @p --type and @p --outdir parameters.  JSON results now saved to @p output.json.
1.1.15-1	| 2021-07-22	| Fixed a DOS end-of-line reading problem when parsing the .cfg file in Linux.
1.1.14-3	| 2021-05-30	| Created <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stephanecharette/DarkHelp/tree/master/example_project">example project</a> to help people understand how to use the C++ library.
1.1.14-1	| 2021-05-30	| Restart the Windows port of %DarkHelp.
1.1.13-1	| 2021-04-08	| Don't automatically enable @p use_cuda_graph since it seems to cause problems for video cards.
1.1.12-1	| 2021-04-08	| Combining tiles works better with the introduction of @ref DarkHelp::Config::only_combine_similar_predictions.
1.1.9-1		| 2021-03-02	| @ref DarkHelp::NN::init() now sets @p use_cuda_graph (see @ref DarkHelp::Config::modify_batch_and_subdivisions).
1.1.7-1		| 2021-02-22	| Added the ability to merge annotations when using image tiling.
1.1.4-1		| 2021-02-01	| Converted from private subversion repo to Github repo (https://github.com/stephanecharette/DarkHelp/).
1.1.3-3101	| 2020-12-13	| Added @ref DarkHelp::Config::annotation_suppress_classes.
1.1.2-3098	| 2020-12-09	| No changes. Rebuilt to match most recent version of darknet.
