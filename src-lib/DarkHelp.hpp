/** @file
 * DarkHelp is a C++ helper layer for accessing Darknet.  It was developed and tested with AlexeyAB's fork of the
 * popular Darknet project, which is now maintained by Hank.ai:  https://github.com/hank-ai/darknet
 *
 * @note The original darknet.h header file defines structures in the global namespace with names such as "image" and
 * "network" which are likely to cause problems in large existing projects.  For this reason, the DarkHelp class uses
 * a void* for the network and will only include darknet.h if explicitly told it can.
 *
 * Unless you are using darknet's "image" class directly in your application, it is probably best to NOT define this
 * macro, and not include darknet.h.  (The header is included by DarkHelp.cpp, so you definitely still need to have it,
 * but the scope of where it is needed is confined to that one .cpp file.)

/** The %DarkHelp namespace contains (almost) everything in the %DarkHelp library.  Prior to version 1.4, @p %DarkHelp
 * was the name of a class.  But in October/November 2021, a large code re-organization took place, and the previous
 * class definition was split into multiple classes across several files.  This makes things easier to manage and was
 * needed to support other projects like DarkHelpFPS.
 *
 * Appologies to everyone who has code that relied on the previous @p %DarkHelp API.  The old @p %Darkhelp class has
 * been renamed to @ref DarkHelp::NN, and the settings that used to be in @p %DarkHelp have been moved to
 * @ref DarkHelp::NN::config.
 *
 * @since November 2021
