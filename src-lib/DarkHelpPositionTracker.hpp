namespace DarkHelp
{
	/** This class attempts to do @em very @em simple object tracking based on the position of the object.  It assumes
	 * that objects move a small amount between frames, and don't randomly appear and disapear from view.
	 *
	 * The tracker stores location rectangles for all objects.  This data is kept in @ref DarkHelp::PositionTracker::Obj::fids_and_rects
	 * which stores the rectangles by frame IDs (aka "fids").  This mapping between frame IDs and rectangles increases in
	 * size very quickly, which is why the tracker places a limit on how large it is allowed to grow.  This can be modified
	 * using @ref DarkHelp::PositionTracker::maximum_number_of_frames_per_object.  This puts an upper limit on the number
	 * of past rectangles, meaning that recent location is kept while older historical location rectangles are deleted.
	 *
	 * When a new frame is processed and @ref DarkHelp::PositionTracker::add() is called with the results, the tracker
	 * computes the distance between the center of the rectangle to the previous known center coordinates of all tracked
	 * objects.  The possible classes are compared, and already-identified objects are excluded.  The remaining results are
	 * ordered by distance between past known locations and the new current location.  If the distance is less than or equal
	 * to @ref DarkHelp::PositionTracker::maximum_distance_to_consider then we assume this is a match, and we assign it the
	 * same object ID as the previous frame.  If the distance is greater, then we assume this is a new object and assign
	 * it a new unique object ID.
	 *
	 * Once an object has not appeared (or matched) for several consecutive frames, @em all information on that object is
	 * removed from the container of tracked objects.  The length of time (aka "frames") before this behaviour triggers
	 * is controlled using @ref DarkHelp::PositionTracker::age_of_objects_before_deletion.
	 *
	 * @li This tracker works best when the camera frame rate is high enough to @ref DarkHelp::PositionTracker::maximum_distance_to_consider "minimize the distance" an object moves.
	 * @li This tracker makes no attempt to re-identify objects that move off-screen and then come back into view.  A new ID will be assigned to the object.
